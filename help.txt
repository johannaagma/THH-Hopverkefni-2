Before you start the game you can chose one of six levels.

	Level 1: 5 rows in the pyramid and color does not matter.
	Level 2: 6 rows in the pyramid and color does not matter.
	Level 3: 7 rows in the pyramid and color does not matter.
	Level 4: 5 rows in the pyramid and color does matter.
	Level 5: 6 rows in the pyramid and color does matter.
	Level 6: 7 rows in the pyramid and color does matter.
	
"Color does not matter" chosen:

	One card is facing up on the bottom of the screen in the beginning.
	You can move cards form the pyramid onto this card if the 
	card value is on higher or on lower than the card on the bottom.
	You can also match king to ace and ace to king.
	If no card facing up in the pyramid is one higher or one lower than 
	the card on the bottom, you can pick a new card from the deck.
	When you have all the cards from the pyramid in your bottom pile: 
				You have WON!
	If your deck on the right is empty before you have 
	the whole pyramid in your pile, you have lost.
	
"Color does matter" chosen:

	Same rules as in "Color does not matter" but your card from 
	the pyramid needs to be of the opposite color.
	For example: You can put red 3 and red 5 to a black 4.
